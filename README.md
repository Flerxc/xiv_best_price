# XIV Best Price Calculator

## Context

This app uses the Universalis Market API to find which item sells for the highest price. For the moment, it only checks the market for the Jenova server. If no item has a market price higher than its' vendor sell price, a message will tell the user to come back later.

## Installation

Download on your phone one of the `apk` files from the [latest release](https://github.com/Flerxc/xiv_best_price/releases). If you do not know which one to choose, download `xiv_best_price-release.apk` and open it on your phone.
