# XIV Best Price Calculator

## Context

This app utilizes the [Universalis Market](https://universalis.app) API to identify the item with the highest selling price. Currently, it exclusively scans the market for the Jenova server. If there isn't any item with a market price exceeding its vendor sell price, a message will prompt the user to return later.

## Installation

On your phone, download one of the `apk` files from the [latest release](https://github.com/Flerxc/xiv_best_price/releases). If you're unsure which one to select, opt for `xiv_best_price-release.apk` and install it on your phone.

For further details on apk installation, refer to [this article](https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185).
